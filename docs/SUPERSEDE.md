# The elimination engine

> There is always a dark horse. A curated list that only ever grows becomes a museum — eventually it recommends tools nobody should install.

When a newer tool **strictly covers** an incumbent, the incumbent is retired into the [graveyard](../README.md#-the-graveyard) with the evidence that retired it.

## The rules

An edge `challenger → incumbent` is recorded only when **all** of the following hold. Each rule exists because dropping it produced a false elimination in testing.

| # | Rule | Threshold | Why |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Capability coverage | ≥ 100% | The challenger must do everything the incumbent does. 100% means *everything*. |
| 2 | Popularity | ≥ 1.15× the stars | A strictly better tool nobody uses is not yet a replacement. |
| 3 | Momentum | ≥ 1.00× the star velocity | Stops a stagnant tool from killing a rising one. |
| 4 | Setup cost | no more than +12 friction | A better tool that is much harder to install does not actually replace the old one. |
| 5 | Documentation | challenger within 10 doc points | Prevents replacing a well-documented tool with an undocumented one. |
| 6 | Dominance margin | ≥ 0.55 | Blends the margins so marginal calls stay out of the graveyard. |

A tool is never eliminated by a tool that is itself retired, and a chain (C ⊃ B ⊃ A) keeps only the **strongest direct edge** per incumbent, so the report reads as a decision rather than a transitive closure.

## Lifecycle states

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 🟢 Active | Listed normally. |
| 🟡 Dormant | No commits for a long time, but not formally replaced. |
| 🔻 Superseded | Strictly covered by a healthier tool; moved to the graveyard. |
| ⛔ Deprecated | Marked so by a human in `config/overrides.json`. |
| 📦 Archived | The owner archived the repository. |

## Supersede vs. challenger

A pair can be reported without anything being retired. That distinction matters, because the obvious headline example in this space does not actually qualify:

**`magpie` is a challenger to `cc-switch`, not its replacement.** They compete for the same job, and magpie additionally routes other models through the same agent loop. But magpie covers roughly 62% of cc-switch's capability set, and at the time of writing has about 4% of its stars. Recording that as a retirement would mean this list asserting something its own methodology contradicts — so the pair appears under **Challengers**, cc-switch stays listed, and the engine keeps watching. If magpie closes the capability gap and the traction gap, the automatic rules will retire cc-switch on their own.

A curated entry in `config/overrides.json` is therefore a **nomination, not a verdict**: the claim is re-checked against the same coverage rule the automatic engine uses, and recorded as a `supersede` (retire) or a `challenger` (watch) accordingly.

## The canonical example

**`magpie` vs `cc-switch` — reported as a challenger, not an elimination.** They solve the same problem, and magpie goes further by routing other models through the same agent loop. It is tempting to declare the older tool replaced. The rules refuse: magpie covers ~62% of cc-switch's capabilities and has ~4% of its stars. The pair is therefore surfaced under **Challengers**, which is where a reader deciding what to install actually benefits from seeing it — and nothing is retired on the strength of a claim the data does not support.

## Challenging a verdict

Add or edit an entry in [`config/overrides.json`](../config/overrides.json):

```json
{
  "supersede": [
    {
      "incumbent": "owner/old",
      "challenger": "owner/new",
      "note": "why the new tool strictly covers the old one"
    }
  ]
}
```

A manual edge always wins over an automatic one for the same incumbent, because a human has read both READMEs.
