# Awesome Agent Tools

> **Building an "AGI" out of the tools we already have.** No single agent is enough — one hits its quota, one cannot be reached from your phone, one forgets your project. This is the curated, continuously-verified map of the tools that patch those gaps, and of which ones have been overtaken.

## How to read this list

Every entry was scored from its **README**, not its tagline. The columns mean something specific:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Setup** | 🟢 turnkey (installer or one-liner) · 🟡 needs config or a dependency · 🔴 expects you to build/self-host a stack |
| **OOTB** | Works after install with no source build, no server and at most trivial configuration. |
| **Non-dev** | A GUI or an explicit no-code story, and no server stack to run. ✅ means a non-programmer has a realistic path in. |
| **Stars** | Total stars, with observed stars/day where we have history. 🚀 marks a fast riser. |
| **Score** | 0-100 health score: popularity, momentum, maintenance, docs and accessibility. See [METHODOLOGY](docs/METHODOLOGY.md). |

**Tiers:** 🏆 Flagship · ✅ Recommended · 🔹 Notable · 👀 Watchlist

## ⚔️ Challengers

A challenger covers an incumbent's ground and is rising, but has **not** yet met the bar for retirement — either it misses some of the incumbent's capabilities, or its traction is still far behind. These are the pairs to watch: they are where the next elimination is most likely to come from.

| Incumbent | Challenger | Coverage | Traction gap |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **[farion1231/cc-switch](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch)** | **[yetone/magpie](https://github.com/yetone/magpie)** | 46% | 0.18x the stars (26,620 vs 150,539) |

<details><summary><b>yetone/magpie vs farion1231/cc-switch</b></summary>

Both manage multiple accounts and providers for Claude Code and Codex, and magpie additionally routes other models through the same agent loop.

**Not covered:** Automatic failover, Billing & metering, Parallel execution, Multi-provider aggregation, Session persistence, Skills & plugins, Usage analytics

</details>

## 🪦 The Graveyard

There is always a dark horse. When a newer tool covers **every** capability of an incumbent, matches its traction and is no harder to set up, the incumbent is retired here rather than quietly left in the list. Full rules: [docs/SUPERSEDE.md](docs/SUPERSEDE.md).

## Contributing

Two ways to help, both described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md):

1. **Nominate a tool.** Add it to [`config/seeds.json`](config/seeds.json) with the category you think it belongs to. The next crawl evaluates it against the same gates as everything else.
2. **Challenge a verdict.** If a tool was retired unfairly, or a capability was misdetected, edit [`config/overrides.json`](config/overrides.json) or open an issue quoting the evidence line from the tool's page.

The pipeline runs daily at 04:17 UTC ([workflow](.github/workflows/daily.yml)); every number in this file is regenerated, never hand-edited.
